# AND Digital React Native Expo Training

This project contains 13 branches that go through each exercise on the react native learning slides.

After excerise 5-1 you will need to run
```bash

```
as new packages have been added.



It's an expo project so pretty easy to run!

```

Then press 'i' or 'a' to open the ios or android simulator
